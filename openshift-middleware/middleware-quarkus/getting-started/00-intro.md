In this scenario, you will get an introduction to [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io).

## What is Quarkus?

### Supersonic, Subatomic Java

For years, the client-server architecture has been the de-facto standard to build applications. But a major shift happened. The _one model rules them all_ age is over. A new range of applications and architecture styles has emerged and impacts how code is written and how applications are deployed and executed. HTTP microservices, reactive applications, message-driven microservices and serverless are now central players in modern systems.

Quarkus has been designed with this new world in mind, and provides first-class support for these different paradigms. Quarkus development model morphs to adapt itself to the type of application you are developing.

Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Quarkus uses a technique called compile time boot. [Learn more](https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first).

### Unifies Imperative and Reactive

Application requirements have changed drastically over the last few years. For any application to succeed in the era of cloud computing, big data or IoT, going reactive is increasingly becoming the architecture style to follow.

Quarkus combines both the familiar imperative code and the non-blocking reactive style when developing applications.

### Functions as a Service and Serverless

Thanks to their stellar startup time and low memory usage, you can implement functions using Quarkus to be used in serverless environments like AWS Lambda. You can use any of the Quarkus features in your function and benefit from the fast startup and low memory utilization. With Quarkus, you can embrace this new world without having to change your programming language.

### Developer Joy
Quarkus provides a cohesive platform for optimized _developer joy_:

* Unified configuration
* Zero config, live reload in the blink of an eye
* Streamlined code for the 80% common usages, flexible for the 20%
* No hassle native executable generation
