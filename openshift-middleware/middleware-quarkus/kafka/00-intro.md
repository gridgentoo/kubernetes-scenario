In this exercise, you will use the Quarkus Kafka extension to build a streaming application using MicroProfile Reative
Streams Messaging and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org), a distributed streaming platform. 

## What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. A streaming platform has three key capabilities:

  - Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
  - Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
  - Process streams of records as they occur.

Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

  - Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
  - Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data
