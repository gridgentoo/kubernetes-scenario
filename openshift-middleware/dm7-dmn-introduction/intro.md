Red Hat Decision Manager is a highly powerful, extremely fast and lightweight Decision Management and Business Rules platform. It can be used in a vast array of scenario's and support multiple deployment topologies. More information on Red Hat Decision Manager can be found on the [Red Hat Website](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/business-rules) or the website of the [Red Hat Developer Program](https://developers.redhat.com/products/brms/overview/)

In this course you will learn how to create your first Decision Model & Notation (DMN) based Decision Service on Red Hat Decision Manager. The project will be built in the Decision Manager web-based workbench, that allows both developers and business users (e.g. business analysts) to create, manage and maintain DMN models  and decision services. This *workbench* is called **Decision Central**. We will deploy and run the rules on the lightweight and cloud-native Red Hat Decision Manager Decision Server on OpenShift.
