In this scenario you've learned how to build a DMN-based Decision Service on OpenShift.

We started by defining our project in the Red Hat Decision Manager web-based workbench *Decision Central*. Next, we created our fist DMN DRD model, in which we defined our data input and decision nodes. We've use a DMN Decision Table to implement the logic of our decision node.

Using the *Deployment* functionality in Decision Central, we were able to compile and package our DMN model in a Deployment Unit (KJAR) and deploy it on a Decision Server running in OpenShift

Finally we tested our rules using the Swagger UI provided by the Decision Server.

Red Hat Decision Manager supports many more use-cases and scenarios. Please consult the various online resources (manuals, blogs, demos, forums, etc.) to continue your Red Hat Decision Manager journey.
