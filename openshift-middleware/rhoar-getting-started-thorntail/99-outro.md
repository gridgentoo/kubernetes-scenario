In this scenario you learned a bit more about what Thorntail is, how it implements the [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io) specification, and how it can be used to create
modern Java microservice-oriented applications.

You took an existing application and developed a new __health check__ for it using Thorntail and MicroProfile,
and deployed the application to OpenShift and tested it.

Thorntail brings in a number of concepts and APIs from the Java EE community, so your existing
Java EE skills can be re-used to bring your applications into the modern world of containers,
microservices and cloud deployments.

Thorntail is one of many components of Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes - check out
other scenarios (for example [the Vert.x scenario](https://learn.openshift.com/middleware/)) to learn about
other runtimes you can use.
