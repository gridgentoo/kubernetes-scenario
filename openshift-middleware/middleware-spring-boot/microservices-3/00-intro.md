In this scenario you will learn more about developing Spring Boot Microservices using the [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar) platform. You will learn what the Circuit Breaker pattern is and why it's useful in an environment where we have multiple third party services that we need to call. Then we'll take a look at how it's implemented and see the functionality live within the OpenShift environment to really demonstrate the value that we gain from it.
