# Review the base structure of the application

For your convenience, this scenario has been created with a base project using the Java programming language and the Apache Maven build tool. Initially the project contains a couple web-oriented files which are out of scope for this module. See the Spring MVC / Rest Services module for more details. These files are in place to give a graphical view of the Database content. 

As you review the content you will notice that there are a couple **TODO** comments. **Do not remove them!** These comments are used as markers for later exercises in this scenario. 

In the next section we will add the dependencies and write the class files necessary to run the application.
