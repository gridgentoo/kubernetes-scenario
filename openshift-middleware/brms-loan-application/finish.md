In this scenario you've learned how to build a JBoss BRMS Micro-Rules service on OpenShift.

We started by defining our repository and project in the JBoss BRMS web-based workbench *Business Central*. Next, we created our fist data-model and decision-table representing our facts and rules.

We made our project available to our OpenShift S2I build process by pushing our project to GitHub. Using the Decision Server S2I template we were able to create our project and JBoss BRMS Decision Server application container image and deploy the container on to OpenShift.

Finally we tested our rules using cURL.

JBoss BRMS supports many more use-cases and scenarios. Please consult the various online resources (manuals, blogs, demos, forums, etc.) to continue your JBoss Business Rules Management journey.
