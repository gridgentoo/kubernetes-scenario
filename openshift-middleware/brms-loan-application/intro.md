JBoss BRMS is a highly powerful, extremely fast and lightweight Business Rules Management System. It can be used in a vast array of scenario's and support multiple deployment topologies. More information on JBoss BRMS can be found on the [Red Hat Website](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/business-rules) or the website of the [Red Hat Developer Program](https://developers.redhat.com/products/brms/overview/)

In this course you will learn how to create your first rules project on JBoss BRMS. The project will be built in the JBoss BRMS web-based workbench that allows both developers and business users (e.g. business analysts) to create, manage and maintain business rules projects and business rules. This *workbench* is called **Business Central**. We will deploy and run the rules on the lightweight and cloud-ready JBoss BRMS Decision Server.
