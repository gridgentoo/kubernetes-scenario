In this scenario you learned a bit more about what Node.js is, and how it can be used to create
modern Javascript microservice-oriented applications.

You took an existing application and modified it to externalize its configuration and separate
it from the application itself, and deployed the application to OpenShift and tested it.

Node.js is one of many components of Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes - check out other
scenarios (for example [the Vert.x scenario](https://learn.openshift.com)) to learn about other
runtimes you can use.
