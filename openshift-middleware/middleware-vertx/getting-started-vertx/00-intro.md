In this scenario, you will learn more about [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io), one of the runtimes included in [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar).



## What you will learn
You will learn how to get started with building a reactive web application that can serve static content as well as server-side business logic using Eclipse Vert.x.

## What is Eclipse Vert.x?

![Local Web Browser Tab](/openshift/assets/middleware/rhoar-getting-started-vertx/vertx-logo.png)

Eclipse Vert.x is a reactive toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine that is polyglot (e.g., supports multiple programming languages).
In this session, we will focus on Java, but it would be possible to build the same application in JavaScript, Groovy, Ruby, Ceylon, Scala, and Kotlin.

Eclipse Vert.x is event-driven and non-blocking, which means that applications in Vert.x can handle a lot of concurrent requests using a small number of kernel threads.
Vert.x lets your app scale with minimal hardware.

Vert.x is incredibly flexible - whether it's network utilities, sophisticated modern web applications, HTTP/REST microservices, high volume event processing or a full-blown back-end message-bus application, Vert.x is a great fit.

Vert.x is used by many [different companies](http://vertx.io/whos_using/) from real-time gaming to banking and everything in between.

Vert.x is not a restrictive framework or container and we don't tell you a correct way to write an application. Instead, we give you a lot of useful bricks and let you create your app the way you want to.

Vert.x is fun - Enjoy being a developer again. Unlike restrictive traditional application containers, Vert.x gives you incredible power and agility to create compelling, scalable, 21st-century applications the way you want to, with a minimum of fuss, in the language you want.

* Vert.x is lightweight - Vert.x core is around 650kB in size.
* Vert.x is fast. Here are some independent [numbers](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r8&hw=i7&test=plaintext).
* Vert.x is not an application server. There's no monolithic Vert.x instance into which you deploy applications. You just run your apps wherever you want to.
* Vert.x is modular - when you need more bits just add the bits you need and nothing more.
* Vert.x is simple but not simplistic. Vert.x allows you to create powerful apps, simply.
* Vert.x is an ideal choice for creating light-weight, high-performance, microservices.
