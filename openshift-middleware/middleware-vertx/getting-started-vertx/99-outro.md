In this scenario, you learned a bit more about what Eclipse Vert.x is, and how it can be used to create reactive microservice-oriented applications. We will add additional scenarios explain more how to build resilient reactive microservices shortly, so check back to [learn.openshift.com](http://learn.openshift.com)

To summarize, you developed a web application that both returned static content as well as server-side generated content using Eclipse Vert.x. After testing them locally (in your terminal window) you also deployed your application to the OpenShift Container Platform, using a single maven command.

>**NOTE:** If you don't like building and deploying from the command line, everything we have done in this scenario is possible in a reasonable modern IDE that supports using maven. For example Eclipse IDE, IntelliJ, or NetBeans. JBoss Developer Studio also provides more advanced tooling.

Eclipse Vert.x is implemented using reactive concepts and also support using reactive programming like JavaRx,

Eclipse Vert.x is one of many components of Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes - check out other scenarios (for example the Eclipse Vert.x scenario) to learn about other runtimes you can use.
