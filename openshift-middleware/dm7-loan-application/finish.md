In this scenario you've learned how to build a Red Hat Decision Manager Micro-Rules service on OpenShift.

We started by defining our project in the Red Hat Decision Manager web-based workbench *Decision Central*. Next, we created our fist data-model and decision-table representing our facts and rules.

Using the *Build & Deploy* functionality in Decision Central, we were able to compile and package our rules in a KJAR and deploy the KJAR onto the Decision Server running in OpenShift

Finally we tested our rules using the Swagger UI provided by the Decision Server.

Red Hat Decision Manager supports many more use-cases and scenarios. Please consult the various online resources (manuals, blogs, demos, forums, etc.) to continue your Red Hat Decision Manager journey.
