### Create an Elastic Cloud deployment
You can use Elasticsearch Service in Elastic Cloud ( http://cloud.elastic.co ), or a local deployment, or deploy containers from https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html

If this is your first experience with the Elastic stack I would recommend Elastic Cloud; and don't worry, you do not need a credit card.

Make sure that you take note of the CLOUD ID and Elastic Password if you use Elastic Cloud or Elastic Cloud Enterprise.
