Let's take a look at the following steps to set up the source folder:

Create a src folder where all your development code will go. Here's what your project setup should look like by now:

Create a new file inside src/ called index.html with this code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Startup</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

The `<div id="root">` object will be where our React project will start. With HTML, webpack, and babel set up, we can start creating the main react.js file that will be used in our project. Inside the src/ folder, create a file called index.jsx, which will contain our initial react.js file:

```
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

class Main extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
        super()
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>The project has been setup.</div>
        )
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Main />, document.querySelector('#root'))
```

Here, we are importing React and ReactDOM for connecting React with our HTML file. Then, we are creating a Main class that has a simple constructor and a render() function that returns a message confirming that the project has been set up properly.
