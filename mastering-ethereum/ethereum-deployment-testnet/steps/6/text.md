Click on **Give me Ether** to select how much Ether you wish to receive. The quantities are limited to up to 18.75 Ether every three days. You'll receive the Ether instantly, but you'll have to wait until that time is reached to get more Ether in the future. If everything went correctly, you'll see a green confirmation message. If not, it's probably because the URL that you provided is not valid. Be sure to copy the URL of the tweet itself:
