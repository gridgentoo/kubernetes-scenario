You can create unlimited accounts with Geth, as they are generated from an algorithm known as Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) that creates the public and private keys off-chain. The number of possible combinations is so big that it is nearly impossible to generate the exact same account as another user. To generate an account with Geth, run the following command:

`geth account new`{{execute}}

This will ask you for a password to keep your credentials safe.
