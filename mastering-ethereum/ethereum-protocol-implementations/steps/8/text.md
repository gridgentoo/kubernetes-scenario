To create accounts with Parity, you simply have to click on the ACCOUNTS tab and select + ACCOUNT, right below the main tab, to generate a new account, as shown in the following screenshot:

#### Mining with your CPU
Parity can be used in coordination with other GPU miners that will provide you with better hashrates so that you can become profitable from the beginning, compared to mining with your CPU. Nevertheless, you can mine with your processor by running the following command:

`parity --author <your-ethereum-address-without-0x>`{{execute}}

You'll then start generating a minuscule amount of ether to that address.
