Parity is one of the most developed Ethereum protocol implementations, since it provides you with a stunning interface from which you can use all the functions, including deploying contracts and interacting with the blockchain.

To install Parity, run this command on Linux or Mac:
`bash <(curl https://get.parity.io -L)`{{execute}}

It will automatically download the latest version, compile it, and get the required components to work right away.

#### Downloading the blockchain
Before being able to interact with Parity, you'll have to download the blockchain, which can be done simply by executing the following command:
`parity`{{execute}}

**Important:** It will take alot of time to download the blockchain. So, you can skip and go throught rest of the scenario. But you won't be able to execute `parity` cli commands in the next steps.

After installing it, you'll then be able to access the web interface on the website, which will show you all the options at your disposal.
