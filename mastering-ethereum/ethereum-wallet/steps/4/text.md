MetaMask is another famous wallet that is mainly used as an intermediary wallet where people send ether to interact with decentralized applications and smart contracts. MetaMask uses INFURA in the backend, so the connection to the blockchain is immediate and you don't have to download hundreds of blocks.

What's interesting about this wallet is that it injects web3.js into whatever page you're examining, meaning that you can use any dApp as long as you have logged into MetaMask:

Whenever you want to interact with the blockchain by making a transaction on a decentralized application, MetaMask will open a pop-up window, asking you how much it will cost you, with gas price included. Then, you'll be able to make the transaction straight from the browser.

What's also great about this wallet is that you can change your blockchain network at any point with a few clicks. This is great for developing since you can deploy your smart contracts to Ropsten and then to Mainnet if everything looks right. Overall, this is a fantastic wallet for developers and users alike who want to interact with decentralized applications, including ICOs.
