These are wallets that keep your funds offline in a small device that stores your cryptocurrencies safely. The interesting thing about these devices is that they don't interact using your private keys; they have a system to log you into wallets without putting your private keys at risk, since they store them internally and are encrypted for increased safety.

The most popular ones are **Ledger** and **Trezor**. Those companies build different devices that you set up with a seed and then use with your cryptocurrencies for as long as they work. Note that they are only as good as a printed private key, meaning that nobody will have access to them online and they will keep your funds safe if you don't lose them. Think about them as keys. If they break or if you lose them, you lose your funds forever. That's why I always recommend that you buy several copies of the same device, three or more with the same private key and seed, so that you can access the same wallet even if one of them breaks.
