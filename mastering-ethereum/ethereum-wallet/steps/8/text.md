Multi-signature wallets are a special type of wallet, in the sense that they are actually smart contracts that implement multi-signature functions so that a group of members can sign transactions when they all agree on the result. The only way to interact with these wallets is by using the smart contract directly or through Parity's application, since Parity created the biggest multi-signature wallet of all applications.

To interact with this type of wallet, simply open Parity's web interface and deploy a new multi-signature wallet from the accounts section with the addresses of the members that will participate in it. The way these wallets work is that each member can create a proposal to move a specific amount of ether out of the wallet to a given address. If they all agree, the funds will be transferred; otherwise, the transfer will be cancelled. It's a simple way for crypto startups to keep their funds in a group treasury.
