**MyEtherWallet** is the most popular Ethereum wallet app, which you can use to access your wallet. It will ask you for your private keys whenever you want to log in; since it doesn't store your credentials online, it's just a platform to interact with your funds:

When you open https://www.myetherwallet.com/, you'll see a clear box, indicating that you can create a new wallet. If you already have one, just click on the Send Ether & Tokens tab, which will ask you to upload your private key in different format options. 

If you don't have a wallet yet, click on Create New Wallet to generate a new account after typing your password. Then, it will ask you to save your private key and store it somewhere safe. Remember that your private key is the main element of your wallet: if you lose it, you won't be able to access it and your funds will be forever lost.
