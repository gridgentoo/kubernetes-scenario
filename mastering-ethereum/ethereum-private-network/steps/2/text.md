Now, you should have access to the geth and puppeth commands. Geth is the main command-line interface that's used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain to download the main chain among other tasks. Puppeth is a tool for setting up your own private blockchain.

You'll need an Ethereum address before setting up your genesis.json file. Create an account with the following command:
`geth account new`{{execute}}


It will ask you for a password. Just type in the password and you'll see your account's address. Make sure to copy it somewhere safe.
