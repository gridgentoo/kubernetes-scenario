Mastering Ethereum development starts with a lot of theory and technicality, but, at some point you'll have to take the leap in order to start applying your recently-acquired knowledge on real-world scenarios that build your portfolio. That's why we're going to create a blockchain-based social media platform, since it's one of the best use cases of blockchain technology, given that we provide people with trust. Unfortunately, many centralized social media companies are abusing that trust by stealing and monetizing users' privacy. Social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook are famous because they give people the power to stay in touch with many individuals in one single interface that takes advantage of the internet's capabilities.

This scenario will take you through the challenge of creating a dynamic social media platform that lives entirely on the blockchain without centralized servers. You will understand how to create a beautiful user interface with React. Then you'll explore how to organize the information better so that you allow people to find the content that they want using smart contracts. Finally, you'll tie everything together using web3 and you'll be able to use your social media platform.

In this scenario, we're going to cover the following topics:

- Understanding decentralized social media
- Creating the user interface
- Building the smart contract
- Finishing the dApp
