Our goal is to create an effective social media platform that overcomes or completely avoids the limitations of the blockchain. To simplify the complexity of our dApp, we will build an application similar to Twitter in the sense that users only share text messages without the option to share images or video. 

Since we are developers, we'll create a Twitter for programmers, designers, developers, and all kinds of technology-related fields where people can feel welcome in a community of shared interests. We want it to have the following functionalities:

- The capacity to share strings of text limited only by smart contract's capacity
- The capacity to add hashtags to each piece of content
- A function to be able to view hashtags that people have included in their content by clicking on a hashtag
- A function to subscribe to hashtags

We don't want people to follow others, we'll simply give them the capacity to follow hashtags so that they focus on the content rather than the messenger. Let's start working on the user interface that will become our social media dApp for tech enthusiasts to focus on content via hashtags, rather than specific users.
