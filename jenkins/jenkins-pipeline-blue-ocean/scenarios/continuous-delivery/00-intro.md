In this scenario you will learn about deployment pipelines and you will create a pipeline to 
automate build and deployment of the Inventory service.

#### Continuous Delivery
So far you have been building and deploying each service manually to OpenShift. Although 
it's convenient for local development, it's an error-prone way of delivering software if 
extended to test and production environments.

Continuous Delivery (CD) refers to a set of practices with the intention of automating 
various aspects of delivery software. One of these practices is called delivery pipeline 
which is an automated process to define the steps a change in code or configuration has 
to go through in order to reach upper environments and eventually to production. 

OpenShift simplifies building CI/CD Pipelines by integrating
the popular [Jenkins pipelines](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/) into
the platform and enables defining truly complex workflows directly from within OpenShift.

The first step for any deployment pipeline is to store all code and configurations in 
a source code repository.
