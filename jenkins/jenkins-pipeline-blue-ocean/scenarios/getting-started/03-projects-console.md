OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to
perform various tasks via a browser. To get a feel for how the web console
works, open a new browser tab and go to the OpenShift Web Console:

```
https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com
```{{copy}}

The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. Enter your username and password and 
then log in. After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with.

Click on the **coolstore** project to be taken to the project overview page
which will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have
running as part of your project. There's nothing there now, but that's about to
change.
