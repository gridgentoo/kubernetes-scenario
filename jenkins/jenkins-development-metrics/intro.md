We are going to integrate code coverage metrics using the Cobertura plugin.

Code coverage is an indication of how much of your application code is actually executed during your testsâ€”it can be a useful tool in particular for finding areas of code that have not been tested by your test suites. It can also give some indication as to how well a team is applying good testing practices such as Test-Driven Development or Behavior-Driven Development.

At the end of this lab you will be able to:

* Install the Jenkins Cobertura Plugin
* Configuring build tools
* Run the code coverage without Jenkins
