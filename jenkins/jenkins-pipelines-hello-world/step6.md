We now will create our first Jenkins Pipeline project.

####Â Task: Create a Pipeline Workflow

1\. On the **Jenkins** dashboard, select **create new jobs** under the Welcome message or **new Item** in the sidebar menue.<br>

2\. Give the job a friendly name, such as **Hello World**, select **Pipeline** and press **OK**.<br>

3\. Scroll down to find on the upper right corner of the Pipeline Script Textbox, the drop-down menu **try sample pipeline...** and choose **GitHub + Maven**.<br>

4\. Review the Groovy code. You will see that we will use git for cloning a sample project and we will build the project using the Maven installation we had named "M3".<br>

5\. Now, click **Save**.<br>

In the next step, we will try it out.
