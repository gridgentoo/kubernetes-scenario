We now have a configured job that will build Docker Images based on our Git repository. The next stage is to test and try it.

#### Task: Build
On the left-hand side, select **Build Now**. You should see a build scheduled with a message "(pendingâ€”Waiting for next available executor)".

In the background, Jenkins is launching the container and connecting to it via SSH. Sometimes this can take a moment or two.

You can see the progress using `docker logs --tail=10 jenkins`{{execute}}

As it's a container, you can view it using the Docker CLI tools `docker ps -a`{{execute}}

It's normal for this to take a few moments to complete.
