## Create a Jenkins Job

In this lab you will create and build a job in Jenkins. Jenkins supports several different types of build jobs. The two most commonly-used are the freestyle builds and the Maven 2/3 builds. The freestyle projects allow you to configure just about any sort of build job, they are highly flexible and very configurable. The Maven 2/3 builds understand the Maven project structure, and can use this to let you set up Maven build jobs with less effort and a few extra features.

At the end of this lab you will be able to:

1. Create a Jenkins Job that accesses a Git repository.
