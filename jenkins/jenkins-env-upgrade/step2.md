The first step is to configure the [Docker plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Docker+Plugin). The plugin is based on a Jenkins Cloud plugin. When a build requires Docker, it will create a "Cloud Agent" via the plugin. The agent will be a Docker Container configured to talk to our Docker Daemon.

The Jenkins build job will use this container to execute the build and create the image before being stopped. The Docker Image will be stored on the configured Docker Daemon. The Image can then be pushed to a Docker Registry ready for deployment.
