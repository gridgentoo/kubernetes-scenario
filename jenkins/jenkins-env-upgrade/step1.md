The command used to launch the container was as follows:

`docker run -d -u root --name jenkins \
    -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
    -v /root/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home \
    jenkins:1.651.1-alpine`

1\. The environment has a Jenkins server running as a Docker Container. You can view the status using `docker ps`{{execute}}.

All plugins and configurations get persisted to the host at _/root/jenkins_. Port 8080 opens the web dashboard, 50000 is used to communicate with other Jenkins agents. Finally, the image has an alpine base to reduce the size footprint.

####Â Load Dashboard

1\. You can load the Jenkins' dashboard via either the Dashboard (right of Terminal, may have to wait a couple minutes) or through the following URL https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

In the next steps, you'll use the dashboard to configure the plugins and start building Docker Images.
