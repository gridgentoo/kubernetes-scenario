Now we have 2 options to Customize Jenkins:

 + By Installing suggested plugins.
 + By Selecting specific plugins to install.

You can choose any of the option, but for now we will select second: Select plugins to install.

On the next page, various plugins are listed with their usage. You can check them one by one.
But for now, we will select none of them.

Click on **None** from upper left tab. This will uncheck all options.

Now click on **Install**

On the next page, enter your details like Username, Password, Full Name & click on **Save & Finish**

Cheers! This completes our setting up of Jenkins !!

Click on **Start using Jenkins**
