In this scenario, we've learned how to implement the knapsack problem using OptaPlanner on Quarkus. We've seen how the Quarkus hot-reload feature enables us to keep our application running while developing our code. We've turned our OptaPlanner Quarkus application into a runnable JAR file that runs on a standard JVM. And finally, we've shown how we can deploy this application to OpenShift, scale the application, and fire requests to it.
