Spark is one of the premier opensource data processing tools and is used extensively in data engineering and data science. It's one of  Apache projects and can be found at https://spark.apache.org/

In this lab we'll install a single standalone spark server and try a few scala and python commands. The lab is active for hour so feel free to do some of the examples on the spark website.
