# Conclusion #

Although this was a very simple Operator, you should now be familiar with the tooling and procedures needed to start developing real Operators used to solve some of your more intricate software lifecycle management challenges.

Using KUDO you can deploy your applications, have the tools needed to operate them, and understand how they're behaving – all without a Ph.D. in Kubernetes.

KUDO lets you configure an Operator’s entire lifecycle using a declarative spec, including things like backup/restore. You don’t have to write Go unless you want to.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these steps you have learned:

- &#x2714; how to install the KUDO plugin into kubectl,
- &#x2714; how to generate an Operator,
- &#x2714; how to configure Operator logic,
- &#x2714; how to package and Server an Operator.
