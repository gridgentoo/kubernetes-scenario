In this step, we will install Python libraries used for deep learning, specifically: Theano,
TensorFlow, and Keras. Note: I recommend using Keras for deep learning and Keras only
requires one of Theano or TensorFlow to be installed. You do not need both. There may be
problems installing TensorFlow on some Windows machines.

1. Install the Theano deep learning library by typing:
`pip install theano`{{execute}} 

2. Install the TensorFlow deep learning library by typing:
`pip install tensorflow`{{execute}} 

3. Install Keras by typing:
`pip install keras`{{execute}}
