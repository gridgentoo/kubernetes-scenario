In this step, we will create a Portworx volumes (k8s PVCs) for Zookeeper and Kafka.

### Step: Create StorageClass for Zookeeper and Kafka

Take a look at the StorageClass definitions for Portworx: ```cat px-ha-sc.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Note that for Zookeeper we have a single replica and with Kafka we have 2 replicas. We also defined a group name for both zookeeper and kafka so that we can take [3DSnapshots]() which will be consistent across the whole cluster. In production environment which larger clusters you would also add the "fg=true" parameter to your StorageClass to ensure that Portworx places each Kafka volume and their replica on separate nodes so that in case of node failure we never failover Kafka to a node where it is already running. To enable this feature with a 3 volume group and 2 replicas you need a minimum of 6 worker nodes.

The parameters are declarative policies for your storage volume. See [here](https://docs.portworx.com/manage/volumes.html) for a full list of supported parameters.

Create the storage class using:
```
kubectl create -f px-ha-sc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}


We don't need to create the volumes because we're going to use a stateful sets and volume claim templates to create them dynamically in the next steps.
