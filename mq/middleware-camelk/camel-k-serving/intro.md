# Serverless Camel K

This scenario demonstrates how to create a simple API based [Camel K](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/index.html) integration with an OpenAPI definition.

The simple API application enable users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete to an generic online objects datastore.

Will also make this RESTFul application Serverless. By allowing this application to scale down to zero. And quickly comes back up and run after being called.

### Your Integration Swiss-Army-Knife native on Kubernetes with Camel K

Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures.

Camel K supports multiple languages for writing integrations. Based the Operator Pattern, Camel K performs operations on Kubernetes resources. Bringing integration to the next level. utilizing the benefit of the Apache Camel project, such as the wide variety of components and Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP).

Camel K integrate seamlessly with Knative making it the best serverless technology for integration. This scenario will get you started and hands on Camel K.

## Why Serverless?
Deploying applications as Serverless services is becoming a popular architectural style.

You will need a  platform that can run serverless workloads, while also enabling you to have complete control of the configuration, building, and deployment. Ideally, the platform also supports deploying the applications as linux containers.

##  OpenShift Serverless

OpenShift Serverless helps developers to deploy and run applications that will scale up or scale to zero on-demand. Applications are packaged as OCI compliant Linux containers that can be run anywhere. This is known as Serving.
