In this step, we will check the state of our sample redis database.

### Step: Verify data is still available

Below commands exec into the running redis pod and dump our sample database.

Use redis-cli to make sure our data is still there.
```
redis-cli -h $REDISHOST keys '*'
```{{execute T1}}

Observe that the keys are still there and intact!

View some of the sample data values:

```
redis-cli -h $REDISHOST hvals 'Redis key naming conventions?'
```{{execute T1}}

```
redis-cli -h $REDISHOST hvals 'When to Redis? When to MongoDB?'
```{{execute T1}}

And see that the data values are still intact!
