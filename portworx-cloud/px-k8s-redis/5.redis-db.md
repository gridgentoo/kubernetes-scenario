In this step, we will initialize some sample data in our redis instance.

### Step: Setup NodeJS and load some data

Setup NodeJS
```
nvm install v8.11.0
npm install
```{{execute T1}}

Now load some sample dta
```
npm start
```{{execute T1}}

You should see trace output as the data is loaded through our node.js app

### Examine the data

View the existing keys below:

```
redis-cli -h $REDISHOST keys '*'
```{{execute T1}}

View some of the sample data values:

```
redis-cli -h $REDISHOST hvals 'Redis key naming conventions?'
```{{execute T1}}

```
redis-cli -h $REDISHOST hvals 'When to Redis? When to MongoDB?'
```{{execute T1}}
