In this step, we will scale the StatefulSet replicas to 3 and see that new volumes will get dynamically created.

### Step: Scale the Kafka ReplicaSet to 3 instances

You can run this command to scale Kafka to 3 nodes:
```
kubectl scale sts kafka --replicas=3
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify that Kafka StatefulSet is finished initializing

The stateful set will now create two new pods (kafka-1, and kafka-2). These pods will start in a controlled sequence so that the Kafka cluster can achieve quorum. Please wait until all three pods are in Running state before continuing to the next step.

```
watch kubectl get pods
```{{execute T1}}

When all the kafka-1 and kafka-2 pods show STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

You can also inspect the volumes again to see you now have 3 volumes for Kafka:
```
VOL=`kubectl get pvc | grep kafka | awk '{print $3}'`
PX_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume inspect ${VOL}
```{{execute T1}}
