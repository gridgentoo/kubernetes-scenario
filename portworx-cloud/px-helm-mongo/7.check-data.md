In this step, we will check the state of our sample mongo database.

### Step: Verify data is still available

Run the client and in a shell.
```
 POD=`kubectl get pods | grep 'px-mongo-' | awk '{print $1}'`
 kubectl exec -it $POD -- mongo --host px-mongo-mongodb
```{{execute T1}}

Now use the mongo shell to make sure our data is still there.
Find one arbitrary document:
```
db.ships.findOne()
```{{execute T1}}
Find all documents and using nice formatting:
```
db.ships.find().pretty()
```{{execute T1}}
Shows only the names of the ships:
```
db.ships.find({}, {name:true, _id:false})
```{{execute T1}}
Finds one document by attribute:
```
db.ships.findOne({'name':'USS Defiant'})
```{{execute T1}}

Our data is still there! Portworx replication makes handling MongoDB a HA easy. Exit from the client shell before continuing: ```exit```{{execute T1}}
