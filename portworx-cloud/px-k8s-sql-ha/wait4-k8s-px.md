Let's first wait for Kubernetes and Portworx to be ready.

### Step: Wait for Kubernetes to be ready

Click the below section which waits for all Kubernetes nodes and Portworx to be ready.
```
./wait4-k8s-px.sh
```{{execute T1}}

`Stork` (storage orchestrator for kubernetes) is enabled for scheduler convergence.
Stork ensures that Kubernetes schedules jobs on nodes, such that
local data access can be achieved for high performance.
For more information, please visit [Stork](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork)

Now that we have both Kubernetes and the Portworx cluster up, let's proceed to the next step !
