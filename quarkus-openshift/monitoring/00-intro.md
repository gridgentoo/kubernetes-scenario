This exercise demonstrates how your Quarkus application can utilize the [MicroProfile Metrics](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics) specification through the SmallRye Metrics extension.

**MicroProfile Metrics** allows applications to gather various metrics and statistics that provide insights into what is happening inside the application. They serve to pinpoint issues, provide long term trend data for capacity planning and pro-active discovery of issues (e.g. disk usage growing without bounds). Metrics can also help those scheduling systems decide when to scale the application to run on more or fewer machines.

You'll then query those metrics with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and create a visual dashboard with [Grafana](http://grafana.com).
