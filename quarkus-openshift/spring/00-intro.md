This exercise demonstrates how Spring and Spring Boot developers can use well-known Spring annotations for Spring Data, Web, and Dependency Injection when building Quarkus applications. Spring developers can quickly become productive with Quarkus using existing knowledge and familiarity of these APIs.

You'll build a relatively simple application that uses Spring Data to integrate (via JPA) with an underlying database, inject beans using Spring DI and expose them as RESTful endpoints via Spring Rest.
