# Conclusion #

**You know know how to create, build, deploy and run a Spring Boot application on Kubernetes.**

It can get more complex than this with different dependencies, Java versions and base container flavors. However this is a great starting point.

If you are concerned about the image size, the startup time or configuring the memory and CPU head over to the scenario _Distilled JRE Apps in Containers_.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these steps you have learned how to:

- &#x2714; write a getting started Spring Boot application
- &#x2714; run a Gradle (or Maven) build when the container is built
- &#x2714; push a container to a private registry on Kubernetes
- &#x2714; instruct Kubernetes to start and application
- &#x2714; access an application service running on Kubernetes
