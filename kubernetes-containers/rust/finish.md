# Conclusion #

You now understand different techniques for writing Go apps and packaging them in efficient containers for Kubernetes. Go is a popular language to write containerized apps. The language was designed for simplicity and efficiency. These are attractive goals when you are writing many application containers for Kubernetes.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these steps you have learned:

- &#x2714; how to write some basic Go applications,
- &#x2714; how to write a basic microservice in Go,
- &#x2714; how to package a Go microservice in a container,
- &#x2714; how to run a Go microservice on Kubernetes.

Hopefully you also understand how Kubernetes is a new type of data center _operating system_ that can run your applications - across multiple nodes on your local laptop, a rack of servers, or any cloud target.
