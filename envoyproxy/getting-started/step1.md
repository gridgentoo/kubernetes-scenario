Envoy is configured using a YAML definition file to control the proxy's behaviour. In this step, we're building a configuration using the Static Configuration API. This means that all the settings are pre-defined within the configuration.

Envoy also supports Dynamic Configuration. This allows the settings to be discovered via an external source.

## Resources

The first line of the Envoy configuration defines the API configuration being used. In this case, we're configuring the Static API, so the first line should be *static_resources*. Copy the snippet to the editor.

<pre class="file"  data-filename="envoy.yaml" data-target="replace">static_resources:</pre>

## Listeners

The beginning of the configuration defines the _Listeners_. A Listener is the networking configuration, such as IP address and ports, that Envoy listens to for requests. Envoy runs inside of a Docker Container, so it needs to listen on the IP address **0.0.0.0**. In this case, Envoy will listen on port **10000**.

Below is the configuration to define this setup. Copy the snippet to the editor.

<pre class="file"  data-filename="envoy.yaml" data-target="append">  listeners:
  - name: listener_0
    address:
      socket_address: { address: 0.0.0.0, port_value: 10000 }
</pre>

## Filter Chains and Filters

With Envoy listening for incoming traffic, the next stage is to define how to process the requests. Each Listener has a set of filters, and different Listeners can have a different set of filters.

In this example, we'll proxy all traffic to Google.com (thanks Google!). The result: We should be able to request the Envoy endpoint and see the Google homepage appear, without the URL changing.

Filtering is defined using *filter_chains*. The aim of each _filter_ is to find a match on the incoming request, to match it to the target destination. Copy the snippet to the editor.

<pre class="file"  data-filename="envoy.yaml" data-target="append">    filter_chains:
    - filters:
      - name: envoy.http_connection_manager
        config:
          stat_prefix: ingress_http
          route_config:
            name: local_route
            virtual_hosts:
            - name: local_service
              domains: ["*"]
              routes:
              - match: { prefix: "/" }
                route: { host_rewrite: www.google.com, cluster: service_google }
          http_filters:
          - name: envoy.router
</pre>

The filter is using *envoy.http_connection_manager*, a built-in filter designed for HTTP connections. The details are as follows:

- ***stat_prefix:*** The human-readable prefix to use when emitting statistics for the connection manager.

- ***route_config:*** The configuration for the route. If the virtual host matches, then the route is checked. In this example, the *route_config* matches all incoming HTTP requests, no matter the host domain requested.

- ***routes:*** If the URL prefix is matched then a set of route rules defines what should happen next. In this case "/" means match the root of the request

- ***host_rewrite:*** Change the inbound Host header for the HTTP request.

- ***cluster:*** The name of the cluster which will handle the request. The implementation is defined below.

- ***http_filters:*** The filter allows Envoy to adapt and modify the request as it is processed.

## Clusters

When a request matches a filter, the request is passed onto a cluster. The cluster shown below defines that the host is google.com running over HTTPS. If multiple hosts had been defined, then Envoy would perform a Round Robin strategy.

Copy the cluster implementation to complete the configuration:

<pre class="file"  data-filename="envoy.yaml" data-target="append">  clusters:
  - name: service_google
    connect_timeout: 0.25s
    type: LOGICAL_DNS
    dns_lookup_family: V4_ONLY
    lb_policy: ROUND_ROBIN
    hosts: [{ socket_address: { address: google.com, port_value: 443 }}]
    tls_context: { sni: www.google.com }
</pre>

## Admin

Finally, an admin section is required. The admin section is explained in more detail in the following steps.

<pre class="file"  data-filename="envoy.yaml" data-target="append">admin:
  access_log_path: /tmp/admin_access.log
  address:
    socket_address: { address: 0.0.0.0, port_value: 9901 }
</pre>

This structure defines the boilerplate for Envoy Static Configuration. The Listener defines the ports and IP address for Envoy. The listener has a set of filters to match on the incoming requests. Once a request is matched, it will be forwarded to a cluster.

You can view the full configuration on [Github](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/6a578630a8f6189f86bc1e6b4b4d7ebffabadadd/configs/google_com_proxy.v2.yaml).
