Congratulations you successfully moved from a static configuration to a dynamic file-based configuration approach.

In this scenario you learned:

* The Dynamic Configuration APIs available

* How to configure Envoy to use a dynamic file-based upstream configuration

* How to make changes to the configuration and see the results in Envoy

In future scenarios you will learn how to take the file based approach and convert it into a API driven approach.
