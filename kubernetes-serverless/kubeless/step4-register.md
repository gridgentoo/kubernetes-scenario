Kubeless supports a variety of languages and versions out of the box. To see the list of runtimes use this command.

`kubeless get-server-config`{{execute}}

To deploy a Python function, the Kubeless CLI tool needs some information:

- The name you will use to access the function over the Web
- The [runtime](https://kubeless.io/docs/runtimes/) to be executed to run the code (e.g. Python)
- The name of the file containing the function code
- The name of the function inside the file

`kubeless function deploy fibonacci --from-file fibonacci.py --runtime python3.6 --handler fibonacci.values`{{execute}}

With the above, here is a breakdown of this function registration request:

- kubeless function deploy _fibonacci_ tells Kubeless to register a new function named `fibonacci`. The function will be accessible over the Web using this name. This doesnâ€™t need to be the same as the function name used inside the code (this is instead specified using the --handler option).

- --runtime python3.6 tells Kubeless to use Python 3.6 to execute the code. Other runtimes are available such as: Java, NodeJS, Ruby, PHP, Go, .NET and Ballerina. You can also supply a [custom runtime](https://kubeless.io/docs/runtimes/) as a container.

- --handler fibonacci.values tells Kubeless the name of the function to call inside the code module. You can see in the Python code above that the function is called values().

- --from-file /tmp/fibonacci.py tells Kubeless to upload and use the /tmp/fibonacci.py file as the source for the function. It is possible to pass a function in other ways.

You can list the new function with the Kubeless CLI:

`kubeless function list`{{execute}}

While the function is deploying inspect the actual Python function source code:

`cat fibonacci.py`{{execute}}

With the deploy command, Kubeless automatically created a Kubernetes deployment and service for your function. Observe that a Deployment containing your function is running and exposed as a service in the default namespace:

Execute this command until _Available_ turns from 0 to 1.

`kubectl get deployments,pods,services`{{execute}}
