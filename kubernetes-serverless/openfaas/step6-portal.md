To access the portal use the same user name (`admin`) and password that was applied in the preparation step for the secret creation. Reveal the password.

`echo -e "The OpenFaaS portal will need these credentials when prompted:\nuser: admin\npassword: $PASSWORD"`{{execute}}

Instead of using the CLI tool, you can also interact with OpenFaaS through its portal. On the right-side there is a tab called _OpenFaaS Portal_ or it can be accessed from this link: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-31112-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

For visibility and understanding, leave this tab open for the subsequent steps.
