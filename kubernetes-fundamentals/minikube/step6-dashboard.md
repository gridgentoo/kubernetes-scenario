Another Addon is the standard Kubernetes dashboard. Ensure the dashboard addon is enabled.

`minikube addons enable dashboard`{{execute}}

When running Minikube locally the simple invocation

`minikube dashboard`

is a convenient feature to present the dashboard in your local browser tab. Because of Katacoda virtualization this command will not work, but certainly you can explore the dashboard with this link or click on the [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/) tab above the command-line area.
