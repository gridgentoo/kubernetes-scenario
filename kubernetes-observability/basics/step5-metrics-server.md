The de facto light monitoring application for Kubernetes is [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server). Metrics Server is a metrics aggregator. It discovers all nodes on the cluster and queries each nodeâ€™s kubelet for CPU and memory usage. There is no long term metrics storage, it holds just the latest metrics. Typically, the server may be installed with a Helm chart.

`helm install metrics-server stable/metrics-server \
--namespace kube-system \
--set args[0]="--kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP" \
--set args[1]="--kubelet-insecure-tls"`{{execute}}

This will install the server in the kube-system namespace along with the last two parameters that allow it to work well in this ephemeral Katacoda cluster.

In a few minutes you should be able to list metrics using the following command:

`kubectl get --raw "/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/nodes"`{{execute}}

If the metrics are not ready, this message will appear

> `Error from server (ServiceUnavailable): the server is currently unable to handle the request`

Once the metrics are ready, a JSON dump of the metrics will appear.

`kubectl top node`{{execute}}

If the metrics are not ready you may get this message.

> `Error from server (ServiceUnavaliable): the server is currently unable to handle the request (get nodes.metrics.k8s.io)`

However, once the metrics are available the normal message should look like this:

```
NAME     CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
master   125m         6%     1049Mi          55%
node01   84m          2%     922Mi           23%
```

Metrics information is also reflected in the dashboard. Launch the [Kubernetes dashboard](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/) and in pages for each resource the same Top information appears in the UI. The [Horizontal Pod Autoscalar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) also utilizes these vital metrics to make decisions to scale up and down Pod instances.

In the past, there was no _Resource Metrics API_ and a service called _Heapster_, now deprecated, used to gather all the cAdvisor metrics and bit more manually. Around the 1.6 to 1.8 Kubernetes releases the _Resource Metrics API_ was added. In concert, Heapster was removed and _Metrics Server_ is now the de facto service that aggregates metrics from the Metrics API.

Metrics-server is a lighter version of Heapster. It gathers the latest metrics for reference and does not store historical data. For the accumulation of trending metrics, the de facto Prometheus time-series database can optionally be added to a cluster.

The [exposed Resource Metrics API is documented here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/resource-metrics-api.md).

Another metric gathering server is [_kube-state-metrics_](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics#kube-state-metrics-vs-metrics-server). It is used to provide metrics information for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). Once you need more metrics that are gathered over time, then typically Prometheus is added to the cluster.
