In this scenario you learned about the change data capture concept and how you can leverage Debezium for that purpose.

You have learnt what components you need to deploy a solution based on Debezium, how to deploy an Apache Kafka broker and how to deploy a Kafka Connect instance with Debezium inside and create a link between the Kafka Connect and source database.

But this is just a beginning of a long journey. Please take your time and look at these resources:
* Debezium [website](http://debezium.io/)
* Extensive Debezium [tutorial](http://debezium.io/docs/tutorial/)
* Debezium [examples repository](https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples)
* How to run Debezium on [Minishift](http://debezium.io/docs/openshift/)
* The [Strimzi](http://strimzi.io/) project for running Apache Kafka on OpenShift
