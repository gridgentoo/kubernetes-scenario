In this step, we will take a snapshot of our Kafka volumes and show how it can be recovered from the snapshot.

### Step: Restore your volumes to the snapshot state

Our snapshot_results file will help us do the restore operation and pass in the right parameters
```
cat snapshot_results
declare -ar pods=( `cat snapshot_results | awk '{print $2}'` )
declare -ar snaps=( `cat snapshot_results | awk -v RS='\r\n' '{print $5}'` )
```{{execute T1}}

Let's restore the first volume and then check it's status:
```
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v r -s ${snaps[0]} ${pods[0]}
```{{execute T1}}
```
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v i ${pods[0]}
```{{execute T1}}

Make sure the restore is successful before proceeding. If the Status is 'up - restore' that means it isn't done.

Now let's restore the second volume:

```
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v r -s ${snaps[1]} ${pods[1]}
```{{execute T1}}
```
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v i ${pods[1]}
```{{execute T1}}

And finally, restore the third volume:

```
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v r -s ${snaps[2]} ${pods[2]}
```{{execute T1}}
```
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v i ${pods[2]}
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Scale your StatefulSet back up to 3 and verify your test topic is back
```
kubectl scale sts kafka --replicas=3
```{{execute T1}}

Make sure you wait for all three kafka pods to be started and ready:
```
watch kubectl get pods
```{{execute T1}}

When all three kafka-* pods are ready hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen and then verify that your test topic is back and has the full data history:
```
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-broker:9092 --topic test --partition 0 --from-beginning
```{{execute T1}}
