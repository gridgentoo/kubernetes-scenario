![Jenkins](/sylus/courses/kubernetes-fundamentals-2/module-6/assets/jenkins.png)

> [Jenkins]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_%28software%28") is an open source automation server written in Java. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.

The following topics will be covered:

- Install and configure Jenkins from Helm chart
- Demonstrating Kubernetes plugin for Jenkins
- Build, deploy and run container from Jenkinsfile
- Update container with canary deployment

> Note: Canary release is a technique to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by rolling out the change to a subset of users before the entire infrastructure.
