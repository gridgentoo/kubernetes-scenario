Robust messaging for applications to connect and scale. RabbitMQ is an open source message broker software that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

These next steps provide an ideal place to start deploying and running one of your first application on Kubernetes. With a Kubernetes cluster and a CLI tool called `kubectl` and `helm`, a few steps will get RabbitMQ running.

You will learn how:

- to use the basics of the kubectl and helm CLI tools
- to install RabbitMQ on Kubernetes

> [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is an open source message broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and other protocols.

> The RabbitMQ server program is written in the Erlang programming language and is built on the Open Telecom Platform framework for clustering and failover. Client libraries to interface with the broker are available for all major programming languages. [-- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RabbitMQ)
