Before running the Operator, Kubernetes needs to know about the new custom
resource definition the Operator will be watching.

### Deploy the Memcached Custom Resource Definition (CRD):

`oc create -f deploy/crds/cache.example.com_memcacheds_crd.yaml`{{execute}}

By running this command, we are creating a new resource type, `memcached`, on the cluster. __We will give our Operator work to do by creating and modifying resources of this type.__

## Ways to Run an Operator

Once the CRD is registered, there are two ways to run the Operator:

* As a Pod inside a Kubernetes cluster
* As a Go program outside the cluster using Operator-SDK. This is great for local development of your Operator.

For the sake of this tutorial, we will run the Operator as a Go program outside the cluster using Operator-SDK.
