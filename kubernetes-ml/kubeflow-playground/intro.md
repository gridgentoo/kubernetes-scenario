Kubeflow is an open, community driven project to make it easy to deploy and manage an Machine Learning stack on Kubernetes.

This scenario is in the process of drafting. However, you will see that a functional Kubeflow instance will be running and is open to experimentation. If you know Kubeflow, your feedback to support@katacoda.com and jonathan.johnson@dijure.com would be helpful.

You will learn how:

> [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. Its goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way to deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures. Anywhere you are running Kubernetes, you should be able to run Kubeflow.
