In this step, we will learn OpenShift CLI using the command _oc_.

Before we begin, make sure that your OpenShift is up and running. Let's login as system:admin user since managing quotas & limits requires admin privileges:
`oc login -u system:admin`{{execute}}

# Output

```
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
```
