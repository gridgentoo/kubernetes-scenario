A summary of the build process can be displayed by running the oc status or oc status -v commands:


`oc status -v`{{execute}}

View details with 'oc describe <resource>/<name>' or list everything with 'oc get all'.
The preceding command shows that deployment #1 has been rolled out. It can also contain some useful information for troubleshooting the build, in case something goes wrong.

There is another way to display build logs with low-level detailsâ€”using the oc logs command. We need to show the log for the buildconfig (or just bc) entity, which can be displayed, as follows, by using the oc logs bc/phpinfo command:
`oc logs bc/phpinfo`{{execute}}

```
