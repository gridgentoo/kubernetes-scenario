There are multiple container management solutions available, with the most popular being Kubernetes and Docker Swarm:

**Kubernetes:** It's built around the concept of resourcesâ€”complex API entities that serve as an interface to the underlying mechanisms and serialized in YAML or JSON. All software components run on two types of machine: masters and nodes. Masters perform management, dispatching, and synchronization functions, while nodes provide a runtime environment for running containers.


**Docker Swarm:** Docker Swarm is a native container orchestration solution provided by the Docker project. It has many features that Kubernetes provides, but does this using different mechanisms and can be used to quickly deploy a single service or even a stack of services on worker nodes. Swarm Cluster consists of two types of node: managers and workers. Managers control the placement of containers, which are referred to as tasks in Swarm terminology, and workers do the heavy lifting of running containers.
