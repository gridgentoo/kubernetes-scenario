Now, we will create our own simple template. Create a new template definition with the following contents:

<pre class="file" data-filename="example-template.yml" data-target="replace">
kind: Template
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: example-template
labels:
  role: web
message: You chose to deploy ${WEB_SERVER}
objects:
  - kind: Pod
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: example-pod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: ${WEB_SERVER}
          image: ${WEB_SERVER}
  - kind: Service
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: example-svc
    spec:
      ports:
        - port: 80
      selector:
        role: web
  - kind: Route
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: example-route
    spec:
      to:
        kind: Service
        name: example-svc
parameters:
  - name: WEB_SERVER
    displayName: Web Server
    description: Web server image to use
    value: nginx
</pre>


Note
Though in our case the message parameter is used in quite a rudimentary way, in more complex templates, its purpose is to tell the user how to use the templateâ€”what usernames, passwords, URLs, and so on were generated.

This template can be used to create three resources:

- A pod running a web server, which you can choose by supplying the WEB_SERVER parameter. By default, it's nginx.
- A service proxying incoming traffic to the pod.
- A route for external access.

We can process that definition right away and pass the resulting list of resources to the create command, but a common strategy is to create a template from its definition first:
`oc create -f example-template.yml`{{execute}}
