### Thanks for joining us!
During this scenario we deployed a sample application, deployed the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, and three Beats), and visualized the logs and metrics from the sample application and the Docker infrastructure.  To learn more head over to https://www.elastic.co/start  and deploy an Elasticsearch Service deployment in Elastic Cloud, or download and run on your own systems.  

### More information about managing container environments
Head over to the [Elastic container management page](https://www.elastic.co/docker-kubernetes-container-monitoring) and learn about things that other customers are doing, and see what new things are available.

### Join the conversation
A great place to talk to other Elastic users and the developers is https://discuss.elastic.co  If you have a question, need a hand, or want to bounce an idea off of other people come on over and join the conversation.  Most of the container management discussion will be in the [Beats area](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/beats), as Beats are commonly used to ship data from container environments.
