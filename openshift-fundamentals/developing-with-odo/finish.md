Congratulations! You just learned the basics of using the `odo` tool to manage application components on the OpenShift Container Platform.

## What's next?

We hope `odo` helps you conveniently access all the power OpenShift has to offer, and that these first steps leave you eager to learn more. https://learn.openshift.com has other tutorials from basic to advanced that offer a real cluster to learn on, just like this scenario. It's also easy to run your own OpenShift cluster locally or to leave infrastructure management to Red Hat experts by using a hosted OpenShift.

Here are some of the ways you can get your own OpenShift cluster:

### CodeReady Containers

[CodeReady Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers) brings a minimal, preconfigured OpenShift 4.x cluster to your local laptop or desktop computer for development and testing purposes. CodeReady Containers is delivered as a Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine that supports native hypervisors for Linux, macOS, and Windows 10. Follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/) to set up CodeReady Ready Containers.

### OpenShift Online

The OpenShift team provides a hosted, managed environment that frees developers from worrying about infrastructure. OpenShift Online includes a free *Starter* tier for developing and testing applications on OpenShift. OpenShift Online Pro provides scalability for production deployments at competitive monthly rates in a multi-tenant environment.

### OpenShift Dedicated

For the highest production requirements, Red Hat hosts and manages dedicated OpenShift instances available only to your organization. OpenShift Dedicated is ideal for larger teams that want the scale and velocity benefits of container cluster orchestration without having to sweat the details of deploying and maintaining secure, reliable infrastructure.
