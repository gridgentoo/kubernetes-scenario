## Goal

Learn how to use the *OpenShift Do* (`odo`) command line tool to build and deploy applications on OpenShift.

## Concepts

* `odo` developer tool abstracts deployment tasks
* OpenShift Projects and Applications
* OpenShift Web Console’s Developer Perspective
* Multi-tiered applications with a web frontend
* Automatic OpenShift Builds for iterative development

## Use case

Odo is a developer-centric tool for building and running software on OpenShift. Odo streamlines common build and deployment tasks to let you focus on your application’s source code. You can use odo to reduce the cognitive load and rote steps of building components, linking them together, and routing traffic to them on the OpenShift Container Platform.

This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.
