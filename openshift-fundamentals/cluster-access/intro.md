Learn how to log in to OpenShift with the web console and with the `oc` command line tool.

## Concepts

* OpenShift user authentication and authorization basics
* OpenShift Web Console
* OpenShift `oc` tool
* OpenShift Projects and collaboration

You must log in to do anything on an OpenShift cluster. To collaborate on an OpenShift Project, you can authorize other users to see or modify resources in your Projects.

This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.
