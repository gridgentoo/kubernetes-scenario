Users are increasingly interested in using Kubernetes in hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.

Many of those scenarios involve deploying services in multiple clusters across different data centers and clouds. Red Hat has been working in the Kubernetes Multi-cluster SIG and Federation Working Group to develop [Kubernetes KubeFed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed) which is designed to allow users to deploy services and workloads to multiple clusters from a single API.

This course will guide you through the Federation Deployment based on Kubernetes KubeFed and you will end up deploying a federated application.
