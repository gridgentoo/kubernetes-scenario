## Goal

Learn how to use the OpenShift Container Platform to build and deploy an application with a data backend and a web frontend.

## Concepts

* OpenShift Web Console and Perspectives
* OpenShift `oc` command line tool
* Building applications from source on OpenShift
* OpenShift REST API
* Public URLs and OpenShift Routes

## Use case

Be able to provide a great experience for both Developers and System Administrators to develop, deploy, and run containerized applications using OpenShift. Developers should love using OpenShift because it enables them to take advantage of both containerized applications and orchestration without having to know the details. Developers are free to focus on their code instead of spending time writing Dockerfiles and running docker builds.

This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.
