Before we get started, you need to login and create a project in OpenShift
to work in.

To login to the OpenShift cluster used for this course from the _Terminal_,
run:

``oc login -u developer -p developer``{{execute}}

This will log you in using the credentials:

* **Username:** ``developer``
* **Password:** ``developer``

You should see the output:

```
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
```

To create a new project called ``myproject`` run the command:

``oc new-project myproject``{{execute}}

You should see output similar to:

```
Now using project "myproject" on server "https://openshift:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app django-psql-example

to build a new example application in Python. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node
```

Switch to the _Console_ and login to the OpenShift web console using the
same credentials you used above.

This should leave you at the list of projects you have access to. As we only
created the one project, all you should see is ``myproject``.

![List of Projects](../../assets/introduction/deploying-python-42/01-list-of-projects.png)

Click on ``myproject`` and you should then be at the _Overview_ page for
the project. Select the _Developer_ perspective for the project instead of the _Adminstrator_ perspective in the left hand side menu. If necessary click on the hamburger menu icon top left of the web console to expose the left hand side menu.

As the project is currently empty, no workloads should be found and you will be presented with various options for how you can deploy an application.
