## Goal

Learn how to deploy an application on OpenShift with the web console and with the `oc` command line tool.

## Concepts

* Deploying existing container images on an OpenShift cluster
* OpenShift Web Console’s Topology view
* OpenShift Projects and Applications
* OpenShift `oc` tool’s `new-app` subcommand

## Use case

You can deploy a container image on an OpenShift cluster to make the application easier to manage, scale, connect and monitor.

This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.
