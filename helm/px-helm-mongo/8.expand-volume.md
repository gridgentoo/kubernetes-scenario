In this step, we will run a benchmark and run out of space to show how easy it is to add space to a volume dynamically.

### Step: Inspect the volume

You can run pxctl commands to inspect your volume:
```
VOL=`kubectl get pvc | grep px-mongo-pvc | awk '{print $3}'`
PX_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume inspect ${VOL}
```{{execute T1}}

You can also get the PVC using kubectl and see that it has 10Gi capacity:
```
kubectl get pvc px-mongo-pvc
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Expand the volume

Since we added the ```allowVolumeExpansion: true``` attribute to our storage class you can expand the PVC by editing the px-mongo-pvc.yaml file and then re-applying this file using kubectl.

```
sed -i 's/10Gi/20Gi/g' px-mongo-pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f px-mongo-pvc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Inspect the volume and verify that it now has 20Gi capacity:
```
kubectl get pvc px-mongo-pvc
```{{execute T1}}

As you can see the volume is now  expanded and our MongoDB database didn't require restarting.
```
kubectl get pods
```{{execute T1}}
