Interact. Analyze. Communicate.

These next steps demonstrating using R based Shiny applications on Kubernetes. With a Kubernetes cluster and a CLI tool called _kubectl_, a few steps will get Shiny servers running.

You will learn how:

- to use the basics of the kubectl CLI tool
- to install Shiny R applications on Kubernetes
- containers are deployed as Deployments in Pods
- a Service can provide access to a Pod

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, HTML widgets, and JavaScript actions.
