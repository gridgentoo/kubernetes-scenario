### Waiting for the test data to be generated
We need to generate some test data for Prometheus which can take a couple of minutes. <br>
Once the environment is set up, lets see how to access it.

### Accessing the Prometheus Console
* The Prometheus console can be accessed using the following url: <br>
http://prometheus-demo-route-myproject.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

  ![Prometheus Console](../../assets/ai-machine-learning/prometheus-api-client/02-prometheus-console.png)

* To check if the test data was generated successfully, go to the following url: <br>
  http://prometheus-demo-route-myproject.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/graph?g0.range_input=12h&g0.expr=test&g0.tab=0

* The above link will query the Prometheus instance for a metric called `test` for the past 12 hours and if the data was generated successfully your Prometheus console should look like this:

### Accessing the Jupyter Notebooks Environment

* The Jupyter environment with the workshop notebooks is available here: <br>
http://prometheus-anomaly-detection-workshop-myproject.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

* You will need a password to access the environment. <br>
  The password is `secret`{{copy}} <br>
  ![Jupyter Environment Secret](../../assets/ai-machine-learning/prometheus-api-client/02-jupyter-secret.png)

* There are 2 notebooks available in the Jupyter environment:
  1. `(Exercises) Introduction_Prometheus_API_Client.ipynb` - In this notebook you will explore and solve few exercises on using the Prometheus API client.
  2. `(Solutions) Introduction_Prometheus_API_Client.ipynb` - You will find the solutions to the exercises in this notebook. <br><br>

  ![Jupyter Notebook List](../../assets/ai-machine-learning/prometheus-api-client/02-jupyter-notebook-list.png)

* The idea behind this scenario is to work through the `Exercises` notebook and only check the solutions notebook when you need help.

That's it, once you are done with the notebooks you have finished this scenario. <br>
The next step will just show you how to access the backend for this scenario, you can safely skip it.
