In this workshop you learnt how you can deploy a workspace for working on Jupyter notebooks which is backed by persistant storage, ensuring that any changes made to your notebook files, and that any additional Python packages you manually install, are always available, even across a restart of the workspace environment.

Further details on the example Jupyter notebook images and templates used in this workshop can be found at:

This Git repository is part of the [Jupyter on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift) project, a community project for demonstrating how Jupyter notebooks and JupyterHub can be deployed to OpenShift.

Check out the other workshops here for details of how to create your own custom notebook images, and how to deliver Jupyter notebooks to multiple users at the same time using JupyterHub.
