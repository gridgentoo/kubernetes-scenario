You can work with the templates using either the command line or the OpenShift web console. We will use the command line to deploy the template in this workshop.

If you still want to make use of the web console, click on the _Console_ tab in the workshop dashboard. You will be presented with the OpenShift login screen.

For the credentials, enter:

* **Username:** ``admin``{{copy}}
* **Password:** ``admin``{{copy}}

Once you have logged in, you can then interact with the cluster and examine what happens as we work through the workshop.
