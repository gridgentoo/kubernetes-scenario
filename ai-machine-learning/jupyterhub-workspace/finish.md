In this workshop you learnt how you can provide persistent workspaces for multiple users, for working on Jupyter notebooks, using JupyterHub. The environment gated access to the Jupyter notebooks using OpenShift cluster authentication. The Jupyter notebook instances were attached to the OpenShift cluster so that users could interact with and deploy workloads to the cluster required by the Jupyter notebooks.

Further details on the example JupyterHub images and templates used in this workshop can be found at:

This Git repository is part of the [Jupyter on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift) project, a community project for demonstrating how Jupyter notebooks and JupyterHub can be deployed to OpenShift.

Check out the other workshops here for details of how to deploy a single Jupyter notebook and create your own custom notebook images.
