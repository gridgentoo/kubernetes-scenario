For the credentials, enter:

* **Username:** ``developer``{{copy}}
* **Password:** ``developer``{{copy}}

Once you have logged in, you should be shown the list of projects you have access to. A project called ``myproject`` has already been created for you to use in this workshop.

In this project you should be able to see a Jupyter deployment. Once the pod is ready, you can login to the Jupyter environment.
