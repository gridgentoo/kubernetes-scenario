# Introduction

In this course you will learn how to train a machine learning model on Prometheus metrics to perform time series forecasting and predict anomalies.

We will use a Jupyter notebook to train a machine learning model on sample Prometheus time series metric data sets.

Please give the environment a couple of minutes to set up.
