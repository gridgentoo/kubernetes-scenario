Please wait for a few minutes while the environment loads. (If you want to look at what's going on under the hood, you can go to Step 3 to access the OpenShift console and come back to this step to login to the Jupyter Notebook environment.)

### Accessing the Jupyter Notebook Environment
* The jupyter environment with the workshop notebooks is available here: <br>
http://pad-workshop-myproject.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

* You will need a password to access the environment. <br>
  The password is `secret`{{copy}} <br>
![Jupyter Environment Secret](../../assets/ai-machine-learning/prometheus-timeseries-forecasting/02-jupyter-secret.png)

* Once you login to the Jupyter environment, you will find the following:
  1. `metrics` folder: This contains sample Prometheus metric data sets which we will use in our notebook for training the time series forecasting (SARIMA) model.
  2. `(Exercises) Introduction_TimeSeries_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb`: In this notebook you will explore the sample metric data sets and perform time series forecasting for detecting anomalies.
  3. `(Solutions) Introduction_TimeSeries_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb`: You will find the solutions to the exercises in this notebook. <br><br>

Now, spend some time going through the notebook(s) and try out the exercises for yourself to understand time series analysis better!
