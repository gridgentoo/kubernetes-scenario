This Git repository is part of the [Jupyter on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift) project, a community project for demonstrating how Jupyter notebooks and JupyterHub can be deployed to OpenShift.

Check out the other workshops here for details of how to create your own custom notebook images, create a persistent workspace for working with Jupyter notebooks, and how to deliver Jupyter notebooks to multiple users at the same time using JupyterHub.
